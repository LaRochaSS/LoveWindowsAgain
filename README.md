 _This is not a product made by Microsoft and it's in no way related to them._
 
Like many things in life, Windows 11 is a mixed bag.

We've been working with the system for some time now and have gotten used to a few things.
And for the things we don't like, there are plenty of third-party tools, such as ThisIsWin11 to fix the issues, and registry hacks to go back to the good old days.

Unlike [ThisIsWin11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11) this app will adress ONLY unnecessary Windows 11 features and try to fix them with minimal effort..

**I have reduced this app to the essentials and laid the foundation for a release in the Microsoft Store (if Microsoft should have nothing against the app name). 
This was not possible with ThisIsWin11 for various technical reasons. Some additional modules are based on the above app and already integrated.**
