### About this app 
**Like many things in life, Windows 11 is a mixed bag.** It sure does look nice and I haven't been so pleased with UI design language since Windows 7's Aero. It is full of interesting features, but you’ll probably never utilize many of them. For example, the frustrating and truncated context menus, then the stuff in the taskbar you never use such as the Widgets feature (at the current stage), the Search, Chat and Task view icons etc., the start menu is essentially gone, the XPS Documents Writer and Fax Printer are some of that OS less essential features. So, why not disable these Windows 11 components you don’t need? 

Some of you know my most comprehensive tool in this direction - namely the [ThisIsWin11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11) tools - But unlike the mentioned app, **LoveWindowsAgain** _(you can also call me LoWaApp)_ will adress ONLY unnecessary Windows 11 features and try to fix them with minimal effort. 

It is the easiest and fastest app of its kind to set numerous settings with just one click. 

The motivation behind this app was to strip down the features to the essentials, so that everyone should be able to handle it. Problems are rated according to the levels LOW, MIDDLE and HIGH. The app follows the design language of the operating system and the usage should be self-explanatory

I tried also to laid the foundation for a release in the Microsoft Store (if Microsoft should have nothing against the app name). 
This was not possible with _ThisIsWin11_ for various technical reasons. Some additional modules are based on the above app and already integrated.

**Source needs some refactoring and will be published soon...**

### Installation
You can download the application on the [Releases page](https://github.com/builtbybel/LoveWindowsAgain/releases).

### Requirements
The app is currently developed for and tested against Windows 11 until Build 22598.200 

Several tweaks and the **More Tools** section should also work on Windows 10, but  I have not tested it myself.
