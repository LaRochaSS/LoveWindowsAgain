**Like many things in life, Windows 11 is a mixed bag.**

We've been working with the system for some time now and have gotten used to a few things.
And for the things we don't like, there are plenty of third-party tools, such as ThisIsWin11 to fix the issues, and registry hacks to go back to the good old days.

Unlike [ThisIsWin11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11) this app will adress ONLY unnecessary Windows 11 features and try to fix them with minimal effort..

**The motivation behind this app was to strip down the app to the essentials and laid the foundation for a release in the Microsoft Store (if Microsoft should have nothing against the app name). 
This was not possible with ThisIsWin11 for various technical reasons. Some additional modules are based on the above app and already integrated.**

Source code will be published soon...
